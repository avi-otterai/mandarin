# LangSeed JS - Chinese Learning App

A React/TypeScript webapp for learning Mandarin Chinese using spaced repetition.

## Data Storage

### Hybrid: localStorage + Supabase Cloud

**Local (instant)**: All changes save to localStorage immediately for fast interactions.

**Cloud (manual sync)**: Click the **Save** button to sync to Supabase for cross-device backup.

| Storage | Key/Table | Data |
|---------|-----------|------|
| localStorage | `langseed_progress` | concepts, srsRecords, lastUpdated |
| localStorage | `langseed_settings` | user preferences (theme, learning focus, etc.) |
| localStorage | `langseed_last_review` | ISO timestamp of last completed review session |
| Supabase | `concepts` | Vocabulary with user preferences |
| Supabase | `srs_records` | SRS progress per word |
| Supabase | `user_settings` | User settings (JSONB) |

**Row Level Security (RLS)**: Each user can only access their own data.

---

## Authentication

The app uses **Supabase Auth** with email/password login.

- No public signup (private use only)
- Create your account via Supabase Dashboard
- All data is isolated per user via RLS

---

## Learning Goals (from user preferences)

**Priority order:**
1. **Pinyin** - Foundation, already comfortable
2. **Pronunciation** - Speaking practice, listening comprehension  
3. **Reading** - Character recognition
4. **Tones** - Struggling, needs focused practice
5. **Writing** - Lowest priority, optional

**Current level:** HSK 1

---

## Terminology

Understanding these terms is key to how the app works:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Added / Known** | A word has been introduced to your study list. You want to learn it. These words appear in Revise sessions. |
| **Mastered** | You've demonstrated strong recall of a word (understanding ≥ 80%). |
| **Studying** | A word is added but not yet mastered. |

**Important distinction:**
- **Adding** a word = putting it in your study queue (chapters feature)
- **Mastering** a word = marking it complete (star checkbox) - either through SRS practice or manually
- **Known ≠ Memorized**: "Known" just means you've added it to study, not that you've fully learned it

---

## Features

### Vocabulary Tab
- **Table view** with sortable columns: Character, Pinyin, Meaning, Type, Chapter, Mastered (⭐)
- **Sticky header** - header stays visible while scrolling
- **Filters**:
  - By chapter (Ch. 1-15)
  - By mastery status (All / Mastered / Studying)
- **Bulk chapter management**:
  - Add words from chapter ranges (e.g., Ch. 1-6) to your study list
  - Remove chapters you don't want to study yet
  - Quick add buttons per chapter showing progress
- **Mass actions**:
  - "Mark all mastered" - for current filtered view
  - "Reset mastery" - put words back into study rotation
- Click any character to see details + SRS progress

### Revise Tab (Flashcard Review)
- **Flashcard-style** vocabulary review with reveal/hide mechanics
- **Session-based**: Randomly selects words from your study list (configurable in Settings)
- **Four reveal fields** (tap to show/hide):
  - **Character** (汉字) - Chinese character
  - **Pinyin** - Pronunciation with tone marks
  - **Meaning** - English translation + part of speech
  - **Audio** - Speaker button (placeholder for future TTS)
- **Weighted reveal**: One field is randomly shown initially based on your Learning Focus settings:
  - Default weights: Pinyin 50%, Meaning 35%, Character 15%, Audio 0%
  - Customize in Settings → Learning Focus
- **Session completion**: 🎉 Confetti celebration when you finish all cards
- **Daily tracking**: Completing a session marks today as "reviewed" (stored in localStorage)
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons, progress bar, dot indicators, shuffle button

**What "Known" means:**
- "Known" = words you've added to your study list (from Vocabulary tab)
- It does NOT mean fully memorized - just that you want to revise these words
- Unknown/unadded words are not shown to avoid overwhelm

### Navigation Bar Indicators
The bottom navbar shows status indicators:
- **Revise tab**: Shows ✓ (green badge) if you've reviewed today, or ⚠ (orange badge) if not
- **Settings tab**: Shows orange dot if there are unsynced settings changes

### Settings Tab
- **Cards per Session**: Configure how many words to review (5-50)
- **Learning Focus**: Set priority for each field (0=Skip, 1=Low, 2=Med, 3=High):
  - Character recognition
  - Pinyin recall
  - Meaning/translation
  - Audio/pronunciation
- **Theme Selection**: 8 themes with live preview:
  - Light, Dark, Wooden, Ocean, Forest, Sunset, Sakura, Ink
- **Display Options**:
  - Character size (small/medium/large)
  - Pinyin display (tones: māma vs numbers: ma1ma)
  - Auto-play audio on reveal
  - Show example sentences
- **Accessibility**: Reduced motion option
- **Account**: Sign out and reset to defaults
- **Save button**: Syncs settings to Supabase for cross-device persistence

### Cloud Sync
- **Save button** in header syncs local data to Supabase
- **Sync indicator** shows if changes are pending
- **Auto-load** from cloud on login
