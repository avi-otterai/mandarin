## Agent Operating Instructions (Read First)

Future agents: this file is intentionally operational. It is the first map for where to edit code safely.

1. Always read `.cursorrules` and `README.md` before making changes.
2. Keep this README between **300 and 350 lines** after edits.
3. If any section feels outdated or uncertain, suggest updates to the user before large changes.
4. Keep README focused on stable contracts and architecture, not fast-changing tuning details.
5. Document known failures/incidents and any mitigation steps.
6. When scripts change (build, data extraction, sync tooling, ML analysis), update the "Script Behavior" section.
7. Never run risky DB migrations without explicit user confirmation and backup strategy.
8. For volatile logic, update nearby module docs/docstrings first, then update README pointers.
9. If a user request introduces uncertainty, propose doc updates in the same PR/task.

## Product Goals and Core Rules

### Learning Philosophy
- Keep users around a ~70-80% quiz success range.
- Track knowledge per modality: `character`, `pinyin`, `meaning`, `audio`.
- Reward recovery: wrong answers reduce score less than correct answers increase it.
- Show progress clearly (overall + per modality).

### Critical Concept: Known vs Unknown Words
Binary categories only:

| Status | Checkbox | In Revise/Quiz Pool |
|---|---|---|
| Known | Checked | Yes |
| Unknown | Unchecked | No |

This is the primary anti-overwhelm mechanism. Do not silently alter this behavior.

## App Surfaces and Where to Edit

### Main Tabs
- `Vocabulary`: import/browse words, toggle known/unknown.
- `Study`: passive flashcards (self-paced).
- `Quiz`: active MCQ + scoring + attempt logging.
- `Syntax`: sentence construction practice.
- `Profile`: progress charts + settings.

### High-Value Files
- `src/App.tsx`: app composition and top-level routing.
- `src/components/Navbar.tsx`: tab navigation.
- `src/pages/VocabularyPage.tsx`: vocabulary list, filters, toggle flow.
- `src/pages/StudyPage.tsx`: flashcard behavior.
- `src/pages/QuizPage.tsx`: question lifecycle, correctness UI, logging controls.
- `src/pages/SyntaxPage.tsx`: sentence construction and grammar practice.
- `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx`: dashboard/settings entry.
- `src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`: user preferences.

### State and Domain Logic
- `src/stores/vocabularyStore.ts`: concept state and vocabulary lifecycle.
- `src/stores/settingsStore.ts`: focus weights, UI and quiz settings.
- `src/utils/knowledge.ts`: knowledge update math.
- `src/utils/quiz.ts`: question selection and option generation.
- `src/utils/syntax.ts`: template-driven sentence generation.
- `src/services/ttsService.ts`: speech playback.

### Cloud/Sync Layer
- `src/lib/supabase.ts`: Supabase client.
- `src/lib/syncService.ts`: sync orchestration.
- `src/lib/quizService.ts`: quiz attempt writes and related persistence.
- `src/types/database.ts`: DB schema typing contracts.

## Change Velocity Map (From Recent Commits)

High-churn areas (expect frequent edits):
- `src/pages/QuizPage.tsx`: layout behavior, answer flow, logging controls, audio UX.
- `src/utils/quiz.ts`: option selection (`easy/hard/expert`), question selection strategy.
- `src/stores/settingsStore.ts`, `src/types/settings.ts`: naming and behavior of quiz settings.
- `src/pages/SyntaxPage.tsx`, `src/utils/syntax.ts`, `src/types/syntax.ts`: syntax generation and feedback quality.
- `analysis/quiz_ml_model.py`, `analysis/quiz_attempts_data.json`: ML calibration experiments.
- `src/App.tsx`, `src/components/Navbar.tsx`: tab exposure and navigation wiring.

Lower-churn, contract-critical areas (treat as stable interfaces):
- known vs unknown word semantics
- modality model and cross-modality scoring intent
- sync safety expectations and cloud/local data guarantees
- database migration safety process

When behavior is experimental (difficulty tuning, ML predictions, syntax/LLM-guided feedback, quiz layout iteration), document details in module-level docs first and keep README at principle level.

---

## Data Model (What Must Stay Consistent)

### Concept (client-side learning unit)
Each concept has:
- Static vocab fields (`word`, `pinyin`, `meaning`, `partOfSpeech`, `chapter`).
- `modality.character|pinyin|meaning|audio` each with `knowledge`, attempt metadata.
- `knowledge` overall (weighted average from Learning Focus weights).
- `paused`/selection state.

### Quiz Attempt (analytics + training data)
Attempt records include:
- target vocabulary id
- question modality + answer modality
- selected option and correctness
- contextual metadata (difficulty context, knowledge snapshot where available)

Do not remove fields from attempt logging without migration and analytics impact review.

---

## Quiz and Knowledge Behavior

### 12 Task Directions
All modality pairs are supported (e.g., `character -> meaning`, `audio -> pinyin`, etc.).

### Knowledge Update Formula
Answer modality gets full update rate; question modality gets partial recognition credit.

Approximate update rates:
- Correct answer modality: +25% of remaining distance to 100
- Incorrect answer modality: -17.5% of current value
- Question modality uses half-strength rates

This asymmetry is intentional and should only change with explicit product decision.

### Quiz Logging Flow
1. User answers.
2. UI shows result.
3. On next question transition, log attempt asynchronously.
4. Support "Don't log" to skip accidental/lucky guesses.

If changing this flow, update analytics expectations and user-facing copy.

### Difficulty and Prediction Guidance
- Difficulty/strategy behavior changes often; treat `src/utils/quiz.ts` as source-of-truth for selection logic.
- Keep README language stable (intent and invariants), and put exact heuristics or scoring formulas in code docstrings.
- If ML predictions affect runtime behavior, document decision boundaries next to implementation and link from README.

## Storage, Sync, and Offline Behavior

### Hybrid Persistence
- Local: browser `localStorage` for immediate state and preferences.
- Cloud: Supabase for signed-in users and cross-device persistence.

Typical local keys include:
- progress state
- settings
- cache/sync flags
- vocabulary page preferences

### Auto Sync Behavior
- Debounced sync after quiz actions.
- Immediate sync on hide/unload when possible.
- On startup, cloud state can overwrite stale local cache.

### Offline Mode
- App remains usable with local cache.
- UI indicates offline state.
- Sync resumes when connectivity returns.
- Local offline indicator test path exists via `?offlineTest=1` in local development.

Any sync strategy changes must update this section and `Known Failures`.

---

## Authentication Modes

- Guest: local-only, no cloud sync.
- Signed in: Supabase sync with RLS user isolation.
- Do not silently change mode semantics; this affects data expectations.

---

## Settings and Personalization

### Learning Focus Weights (0-3)
Controls:
1. Relative frequency of quiz task modalities.
2. Study card reveal preference.
3. Weighted overall knowledge score.

Weight meaning: `0` skip, `1` low, `2` medium, `3` high.

### Other User Controls
- cards per session
- theme
- character size
- pinyin style
- TTS voice/rate/auto-play
- quiz difficulty/selection strategy controls
- PWA reminders (per-device local time + timezone, default 4:00 PM)

---

## Syntax Tab Behavior

Purpose: grammar and word-order practice using known vocabulary.

Current model:
- template-driven sentence generation (`src/types/syntax.ts`, `src/utils/syntax.ts`)
- bidirectional exercises (reading/writing orientations)
- unlock behavior depends on required vocabulary/roles

If generation logic changes, update both this section and relevant template docs.

If syntax adds LLM-guided feedback or a dedicated quiz mode/tab, keep this section high-level and place prompt/selection/rubric docs in `src/pages/SyntaxPage.tsx` and `src/utils/syntax.ts`.

---

## Script Behavior (Update When Scripts Change)

### NPM Scripts
- `npm run dev`: start Vite dev server.
- `npm run build`: TypeScript build + production bundle.
- `npm run lint`: ESLint checks.
- `npm run preview`: preview built app.

### Content/Vocabulary Extraction Scripts
Located under `content/hsk1/`:
- OCR + structure analysis + correction + extraction utilities for textbook-driven vocab imports.
- Scripts are workflow-oriented and may rely on local environment/API keys.

When modifying extraction scripts:
1. document required env vars and dependencies
2. document changed input/output file names
3. document behavior changes in parsing/correction rules
4. add migration notes if output schema changes

### ML/Analysis Scripts
Key files:
- `analysis/quiz_ml_model.py`
- `analysis/quiz_attempts_data.json`

Use them for model experiments and calibration notes, not runtime quiz correctness.
If feature extraction or target labeling changes, log it in README and mention data compatibility impact.

## Database and Migration Safety (Critical)

Historical incident (Feb 2, 2026):
- A migration changed ID references and added a FK path that orphaned/deleted large quiz history.

Never repeat this class of failure.

### Unsafe Patterns (Do Not Do)
- adding FK constraints against remapped IDs without mapping table
- using `ON DELETE CASCADE` on user-history paths without full impact analysis
- destructive table recreation on live user tables

### Required Safety Process
1. Back up production data first.
2. Show exact SQL to user before execution.
3. Explain at-risk tables and blast radius.
4. Wait for explicit user approval.
5. Test on a production-like copy/branch before real run.

### Sensitive Tables
- `quiz_attempts` (history + analytics + ML inputs)
- `user_progress` (current learning state)
- `user_settings` (behavioral preferences)

---

## Known Failures and Risk Areas

1. **Past migration data loss** on quiz history (see section above).
2. **Class imbalance in ML data** can overestimate performance if mostly correct answers are logged.
3. **Unsynced local progress risk** if cloud load overwrites stale local state after interrupted sync.

## Supabase Schema Overview (Conceptual)

Core tables: `vocabulary`, `user_progress`, `quiz_attempts`, `user_settings`, `push_subscriptions`.
RLS expectation: user tables are private; vocabulary is shared reference data.
If schema contracts change, update `src/types/database.ts`, sync services, and README together.

---

## Change Documentation Policy (For Future Agents)

Documentation is layered:
- README: stable product contracts, architecture, safety rails, and routing pointers.
- Module docstrings/comments: volatile implementation details and tuning rules.
- Script headers (`analysis/`, `content/`): run instructions, I/O contracts, assumptions.

Update README when:
- user-visible behavior or cross-module contracts change
- new risk/failure mode appears
- setup/sync/schema/script workflows change

Update module docs/docstrings when:
- quiz difficulty heuristics or selection logic changes
- ML feature engineering, thresholds, or label logic changes
- syntax generation templates, scoring, or feedback strategy changes
- layout/interaction tweaks do not change cross-module contracts

If unsure, update both briefly and keep README high-level.

## Quick Task Routing Cheat Sheet

- "Quiz options are wrong" -> `src/utils/quiz.ts`, `src/pages/QuizPage.tsx`
- "Scores feel off" -> `src/utils/knowledge.ts`, settings weights
- "Sync conflicts" -> `src/lib/syncService.ts`, storage key handling
- "Attempt logs missing" -> `src/lib/quizService.ts`, quiz transition logic
- "Syntax generation bugs" -> `src/utils/syntax.ts`, `src/types/syntax.ts`, `src/pages/SyntaxPage.tsx`
- "Vocab import issues" -> `content/hsk1/*.py`, vocabulary store ingest path
